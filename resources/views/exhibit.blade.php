            <p>Tile Trim effectively finishes the tile for you and is designed to be used on walls, floors and joints between two tiled surfaces.

Available in various formats, Tile Trim Profiles are easy to fit and easy to remove, making them an ideal choice for bathrooms, kitchens, conservatories, and other working areas.</p>
            <p id="text">You should consider using either no spacers, or wider spacers to allow space for the protruding tile. The Tile Trim Profiles typically provide an 'edge' to your tiles.</p>
